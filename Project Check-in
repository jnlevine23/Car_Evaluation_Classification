Project Check-in:
 - Gathered data from UCI Machine Learning Repo, read in CSV file 
 - Have thoroughly explored the data and found patterns in how certain features relate to the class column. Analyzed shape of dataset,
 types of the series, columns and index, encoding categorical features into numeric features, and correlations in the dataset. Analyzed how 
 the different features relate to the outcome of the target. 
 - I can come to a conclusion with the data that I have gathered, but more data would be a massive help. More data would allow me to more 
 accurately find out which model is best in this situation. 
 - I am using multiple modeling approaches to explore this data. This is a classification problem, so I used a logistic regression model,
 a decision tree, and a random forest. I also experimented with tuning different parameters and cross-validation. It seems the random forest
 will yield the highest accuracy. 
 - Only using the 'unacc' column as a response variable. Ultimately trying to determine whether a car will be placed into the unaccepted 
 category, or the acceptable, good, very good categories.
