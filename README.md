# Metis-Intro-to-Data-Science
For my Metis Introduction to Data Science project, I will be examining the Car Evaluation Data Set taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
I will be using different types of classification models to predict whether a particular car is expected to pass an evaluation or not. 
My main goal in this project is to find out which type of classification model can most accurately predict whether a car will be deemed
acceptable or unacceptable when evaluated. After testing multiple classification models on this dataset, I will showcase my results and 
choose the most accurate model for this particular situation. 

So far I know that it will be necessary to encode the categorical feature and target columns into numeric columns so the data can be used
in various machine learning models. This data set will require some cleaning and preprocessing before any classification problems can be tested.
I will also have to look into a binary vs. multi-class approach to the classification models as there is more than one response variable.

I chose this topic because this is a good introductory dataset into the world of classification problems. I also have an interest in cars and 
I am excited to see how my models predict how the cars perform on their evaluations based on the various attributes.
